# FURION: A software for X-ray beamline system design

The Fourier optics-based Ultrashort x-Ray pulse propagation package (FURION) is a versatile and comprehensive optical simulation software primarily used for the design of synchrotron radiation and free-electron laser beamline systems. FURION currently incorporates functionalities such as particle tracing in four-dimensional phase space, particle tracing in six-dimensional phase space, wavefront propagation, pulse propagation, pulse propagation based on six-dimensional matrixes, etc. FURION is also capable of calculating optical properties of materials, including reflectivity, complex refractive index, attenuation coefficient, reflectivity of multilayer, and rocking curve of crystal.

Currently, our research and development team is actively working on developing the FURION user interface, with the aim of making it available to professionals in the X-ray community in the near future.
