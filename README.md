# FURION: A software for X-ray beamline system design

## 1. Brief introduction 
The **F**ourier optics-based **U**ltrashort x-**R**ay pulse propagat**ION** package (**FURION**) is a comprehensive optical simulation software primarily used for the design of synchrotron radiation and free-electron laser beamline systems. FURION not only has the capability to simulate ultra-short X-ray pulse propagation, but also possesses some other functionalities, such as particle tracing in four-dimensional phase space, particle tracing in six-dimensional phase space, wavefront propagation, pulse propagation based on six-dimensional matrixes, etc. FURION is also capable of calculating optical properties of materials, including reflectivity, complex refractive index, attenuation coefficient, reflectivity of multilayer, and rocking curve of crystal.

## 2. Features of FURION

### 2.1. Ray tracing in 4-D phase space: 
FURION can provide geometric ray tracing simulation in the (x, x', y, y') phase space, capable of describing the evolution of transverse beam profile and divergence in beamline systems.
### 2.2. Ray tracing in 6-D phase space: 
FURION can also provide geometric ray tracing simulation in the (x, x', y, y', t, E) phase space, capable of describing the evolution of pulse properties in beamline systems, such as transverse beam profile, divergence, pulse duration, and dispersion. This 6-D phase-space ray tracing can assess the propagation of ultra-short pulses in dispersive beamline systems.

### 2.3. Pulse propagation base on K matrixes: 
FURION can also provide geometric ray tracing simulation in the (x, x', y, y', t, E) phase space, capable of describing the evolution of pulse properties in beamline systems, such as transverse beam profile, divergence, pulse duration, and dispersion. This 6-D phase-space ray tracing can assess the propagation of ultra-short pulses in dispersive beamline systems.


Currently, our research and development team is actively working on developing the FURION user interface, with the aim of making it available to professionals in the X-ray community in the near future.
